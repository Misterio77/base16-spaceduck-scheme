# Base 16 - Spaceduck

This is a scheme for [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/), made by [pineapplegiant](https://github.com/pineapplegiant) and packaged by me.

See the [spaceduck repository](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck) for previews, screenshots, and more.

If you're new to base16 and don't know where to start, i recommend checking [flavours](https://github.com/Misterio77/flavours) out.
